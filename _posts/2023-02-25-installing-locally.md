To install this repo locally you will need to have Ruby and Jekyll already installed, you will also need Bundler. Once you have cloned the repo to your local machine you will need to CD into the directory you downloaded it to and `bundle install` to make sure everything is set up. Then `bundle exec jekyll serve` and your site will be live on https://localhost:4000 

For now there are only two posts and three pages. I have set it up super simple so you can change it as you like. If you have any issues, feel free to reach out on github, or on Discord and I will help you get it up and running.
