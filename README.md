## Bootstrap Starter Template For Jekyll

A basic bootstrap 5 starter theme for your jekyll blog. I just started this template so it is very basic and missing most of the components I want to include, stay tuned for updates. It is a template so you can navigate to the [Repo](https://github.com/yosileyid/jekyll-bootstrap-starter) and click the green button that says "Use This Template" you can then name your repo `gitusername.github.io` and it will create your site. All you need to do is go to https://gitusername.github.io and your site will be live. You can then clone it locally and make changes. 

## Installation

Clone the repo locally and in the terminal type: `bundle install` wait for it to finish and then type `bundle exec jekyll serve` you will need to already have ruby, bundle, and jekyll set up. Follow the guide on the jekyll site to do that. You can also include this theme as a gem in your Gemfile and run `bundle install` then it will include this gem and you will be ready to go. 

## Site Structure

For now the "site" is structured as follows:

```
|-- index.md   = Home Page
|-- blog.md    = Index of posts
|-- about.md   = About Page
|-- /posts
|    [...posts]
```
